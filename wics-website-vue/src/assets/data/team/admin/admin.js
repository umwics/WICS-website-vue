Outside of school, I have a lot of creative hobbies; I enjoy a lot of fibre arts, and do some drawing and scrapbooking as well. My hope this year for WICS is to widen our reach and expand our community as much as possible. WICS has helped me grow so much, and I hope to give other people that opportunity as well. If you happen to see me in the hall, feel free to say hi!",

I’m in my final year of Computer Science with a minor in Statistics, and WICS has been a big part of my life for the past three years. I absolutely love the sense of community it brings, and I can’t wait for you all to experience the exciting events, outreach initiatives, and mentorship programs we have planned this year. When I’m not studying or working, you’ll probably find me lost in a fiction book, watching a good rom-com, or trying out new restaurants and cafés around the city. Oh, and a fun fact about me—I can fluently speak six languages! Looking forward to an amazing year together!",

I am super excited to be working with a very talented and supportive team this year as well as being in such a welcoming community! A little fun fact about myself is that I love music, whether it comes from listening to Spotify or playing songs on the piano. If you ever have any song recommendations, be sure to send them to me! I listen to pretty much anything :)",
