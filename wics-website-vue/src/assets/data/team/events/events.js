I'm a third year Computer Science - Statistics Joint student, and I'm about to start my first co-op term in the fall! This year I'm working on planning more social events, to help make it a little easier to meet other people in comp sci. Being a part of the WICS team has allowed me to meet so many cool people, and I hope I can help others do the same <3 Besides WICS, I also love spending my time climbing, playing bass and guitar, or playing video games with friends :)",
