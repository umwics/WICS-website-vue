Outside of CS, my other passions are being an artist, a dancer, and generally anything creative. This is where my enjoyment of content creation comes from! I hope to bring some new and exciting things to our social media this year, share more in-person coverage of our events, and broaden our posts beyond our events as well!",

I'm so happy to be a part of a club that works to support and create a safe place for minorities within the computer science community! A fun fact about me is that I love playing badminton and going swimming, I also used to play water polo! I'm always looking to make new friends, so feel free to say hi if you ever see me <3",
