      "Hi! I'm Brooklynn Wood, returning as your Social Media Coordinator! Currently in my third year, I am a Computer Science Honours Student and getting a minor in art history. Outside of CS, my other passions are being an artist, a dancer, and generally anything creative. This is where my enjoyment of content creation comes from! I hope to bring some new and exciting things to our social media this year, share more in-person coverage of our events, and broaden our posts beyond our events as well!",
